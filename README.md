## Description
A game based on the mechanics of Flappy Bird, with the character Icarus as inspirtation! This game uses user input to control
the playable character, who must avoid obstacles to gain points.
It allows the player to control Icarus uusing the Space Bar. When the player passes a set of columns, they earn a point. High scores are stored until the game
is closed out of. 
In the future, I would like to impliment a leveling system with different graphics signifying the changing levels.
