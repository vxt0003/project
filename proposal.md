**# Final Project Proposal- Flappy Bird Type Game**

## Repository
https://github.com/vxt0003/project.git

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.
For my final project, I would like to create a simple game based on the tutorial "Learning pygame by making Flappy Bird" by Youtube account Clear Code <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZg49z76cLw&list=PL8ui5HK3oSiF7ZFfwYokCD5myWYhGH24A>, modified and added to in order to make it distinct and my own. This is relevant to media and digital arts as it impliments them both in order to provide the user with an entertaining experience.
## Features
- User Input Controls
	- The player will be able to interact with the game by using the mouse input to make the sprite move through obstacles.
- Keeping Scores
	- As the player avoids obbstacles, their score is increases. If they hit an obstacle, it resets.
- Moving Graphics 
	- Graphics of the background and player character will move as the player clicks giving the illusion of progression foward.

## Challenges
- How to create a menu type interface.
- How to create a pause feature.
- How to create a short sequence before the game begins.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- My ideal outcome would be to create a full and working version of the game with all features in the tutorial implimented,
 along with original graphics and added functions.


Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The flying controls from the tutorial implimented along with original graphics.
